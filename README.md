# terraform-kvm
This is a demo project to show how to create virtual machines on bare metal following Infrastructure As Code. We will use the classical and cheap virtualisation infrastructure provided by Linux and KVM together with Terrafrom, so that you can use Terraform to manage your on-premise servers.

## Introduction and Goals

## Prerequisites

1. Physical machine with ubuntu:18.04 operation system.
2. IP address for the virtual machine within the internal network.
3. [Create bridge network on the host machine](https://github.com/wqhuang-ustc/terraform-kvm/blob/main/docs/bridge-network.md)
4. Manage the disk allocation to isolate different environments

## Step 1: Install KVM hypervisor on ubuntu:18.04 host machine

## Step 2: Install Terraform

## Step 3: Install Terraform KVM provider plugin terraform-provider-libvirt

## Step 4: Create VM using the provider in Terraform configuration files
